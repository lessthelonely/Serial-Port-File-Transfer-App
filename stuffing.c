      Question: is it worth iterating through the old frame (buffer) and make a counter that increases
everytime we find an ESC or a FLAG and then we alloc space for the new frame array pointer with the size
length + counter or do we just do length * 2 (for example, it's never going to be bigger than that and *2 is already an exaggeration).
Which is better: waste resources with a for cycle or waste it with allocating memory?
